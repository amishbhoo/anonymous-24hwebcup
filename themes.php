                <h2>I was running away from someone </h2>
                <p>Pay attention to what this person says and does, as they may offer clues from your subconscious mind to improve your life. This can be a wake up call to recognize your desire or avoidance of some personality traits or character qualities. Often our mind will have another person act out repressed desires or fears so we can become aware of them.
                    Pay close attention to the dream symbol. If the tree is growing beautifully, it indicates that the life path you are currently taking gives you the best results. So keep moving on the course, and you will soon find your way. Open yourself to new people and experiences, and you will quickly see new opportunities coming into your life.

                    Something you previously thought to be one has two sides to it. Whether both these sides will positively or negatively affect you is up to you to determine. Examine your dream; if they appear to be in harmony and make you feel confident, it suggests a positive reward or result that may be coming your way. On the other hand, if you see the twins fighting in your dream, it means both the parts conflict with each other. Put forward a new strategy to address these new issues that will soon arrive in your life.
